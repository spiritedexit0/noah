  <h3>Past: </h3>
  <p>As a young kid, Noah enjoyed writing complex algorithms, making bread and listening

    DMT, or chimps smoking DMT. <br>His skills and attributes included but weren't limited to: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accelerated learning</li>
    <li>Genius algorithm writer</li>
    <li>Bread specialist</li>

  <h3>Bread Making</h3>
  <hr>
  <p>Noah's breadmaking recipe was given to him by a stranger who was caliming to
    have come from a parallel universe in which Noah was never born. <br>Having seen
    the disasterous consequences of this, the stranger was sent to Noah's universe
    to set the course of events right by giving him the sacred <a href="recipe.html">recipe</a>.<br>
    Various attempts have been made on decyphering the ancient text but none succeeded. It is still
    unknown to this day how Noah was able to interpret the recipe.
